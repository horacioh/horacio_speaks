Design systems for developers

## description

Design systems are essentially collections of rules, constraints, and principles, implemented in design and code. These 3 attributes serve distinct functions and provide coherent, systemic order in systems from buttons to single page applications.

The challenge for us as developers is to understand this collections of rules and effectively apply this into our code and components, and this without the appropriate tool its hard.

The goal of this talk is to help you understand the rules behind a design system and UI design in general, and my experience on implementing this using tools that help me embrace this rules.
