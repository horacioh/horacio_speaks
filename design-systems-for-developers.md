Design systems for developers

## description

- designers are like us
- we talk different languages to express the same things in in teh same ways, with the same motivations. we just need to listen and be open to other ideas

Designers are like us. Contrast, Emphasis, Movement, Patterns, Rhythm; these are some of the constraints that help them create design systems for delightful products. If you understand these systems, you’ll understand your colleagues. Design systems are essentially collections of rules, constraints, and principles, implemented in design and code. These 3 attributes serve distinct functions and provide coherent, systemic order in systems from buttons to single page applications.

By default we tend to ignore the complexity on the creation of these systems, but you’ll be surprised how similar and useful these rules are, helping your code to be more modular and reusable.

My whole career is based on trying to make designers and developers work more comfortable with each other, and let them know that even though they speak different languages, both are solving the same problems with very similar solutions, you just have to be willing to listen.

## Elevator pitch

Designers are like us. We all follow a set of rules and constraints that help us create reusable & modular components. We as developers can build and use tools that help us embrace and respect these design constraints. We just need to listen to our designers...

## Notes & motivations

my background is in design and I learn development myself. I've always worked as the missing link between designers and developers in multiple tech teams.
I'm going to talk about CSS, styled-components, responsive design and JavaScript using React. it would be nice that the audience is confortable with React and styled-components.

the main tool I will mention is [styled-system](https://jxnblk.com/styled-system/)

## Relevance

Most companies are interested in implementing a design system as the big ones but its not that simple to materialize one.  The idea is to make the design part of UI more familiar to developers.

## Extra info

I think that there's a need for developers and designers to communicate in a way both understand we are trying to sole the same problem with different techniques and solutions.
